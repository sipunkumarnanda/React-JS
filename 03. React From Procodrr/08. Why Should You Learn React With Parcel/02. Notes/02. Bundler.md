
## 🧩 What is a **Bundler**?

A **bundler** is a tool that **takes all your code files (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and combines them into a few optimized files** that the browser can understand and load efficiently.

### 💡 Why Do We Need a Bundler?

Modern web apps are built using many small files:

* JavaScript modules (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, etc.)
* Styles (`.css`, `.scss`, etc.)
* Images (`.png`, `.svg`, etc.)

But browsers **can't load hundreds of these files separately**—it's slow and inefficient.

A **bundler:**

1. Analyzes your app’s dependencies
2. Combines everything into a **bundle** (often 1 or a few `.js`/`.css` files)
3. Optimizes the code (minifies, removes unused code, etc.)
4. Ensures it’s ready to run in the browser

### 🛠️ What Does a Bundler Do Exactly?

Let’s say you have this React code:

```js
// App.js
import Button from './Button';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return <Button />;
}
```

Your bundler will:

* Read `App.js`, see it imports `Button.js` and `App.css`
* Include those files in the final bundle
* Process and optimize them
* Output a single `bundle.js` and `style.css`
