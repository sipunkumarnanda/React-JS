
```json
"build": "babel ./script.js -d lib --watch"
```

And it generates:

* `lib/script.js`
* `lib/script.js.map`

## Here’s exactly what each file is and **why both are important**:

---

## 📄 1. `lib/script.js` — The **Transpiled JavaScript**

This file is the **output of Babel** after it processes your original `script.js`.

### ➤ What's inside?

* Modern JavaScript (ES6, JSX, etc.) is converted into **browser-compatible ES5**
* All JSX is transformed into `React.createElement` calls (or similar)
* Syntax like optional chaining, arrow functions, etc. are transpiled

### ➤ Why it matters:

This file is what the **browser will actually run** — it’s the "compiled" version of your code.

---

## 🗺️ 2. `lib/script.js.map` — The **Source Map File**

This file is the **source map** for the transpiled JavaScript.

### ➤ What's inside?

* A mapping between each line/character of `lib/script.js` and your **original** `script.js` file
* It tells the browser:

  > “If there's an error or breakpoint here in `lib/script.js`, show the developer the corresponding line in the original `script.js`.”

### ➤ Why it matters:

* Makes debugging in browser DevTools much easier
* When you open DevTools and click a stack trace, it shows the original file + line
* Without it, you'd be debugging the **transpiled**, harder-to-read code

## 🔍 Real-World Debugging Example

### 🔧 Without `.map`:

In browser DevTools:

```
Error at lib/script.js:1423
```

🤯 You're lost in a sea of unreadable transpiled code.

---

### ✅ With `.map`:

DevTools reads `script.js.map` and says:

```
Error at src/script.js:21 → inside handleClick()
```

🧠 Much clearer!

## 💬 Interview-Friendly Explanation

> When Babel transpiles your React or modern JavaScript code, it outputs a new JavaScript file that browsers can understand. This file (`script.js`) is hard to debug because it's transformed. That's why Babel also generates a `.map` file (`script.js.map`), which links the transpiled code back to the original source code. This allows browser DevTools to show the correct line numbers and source files when debugging.
