
### ✅ Key Concepts of React State and Re-renders

1. **Setting state requests a new render**

   * Whenever you call a state setter like `setMessage`, React schedules a re-render of the component to reflect the new state.

2. **React stores state outside of your component**

   * Think of React as keeping your state “on a shelf” and giving it back to the component when it renders. It persists across renders, even though the function body is re-executed.

3. **`useState` gives a snapshot of state for that specific render**

   * Each time a component renders, it gets a fresh snapshot of the state. This snapshot doesn’t automatically reflect future state updates unless another render occurs.

4. **Variables and event handlers don’t survive re-renders**

   * Every time the component renders, it creates **new** versions of functions and local variables. React discards the old ones.

5. **Every render and its functions “see” the state of that render**

   * Functions (like event handlers or timeouts) created in a render will close over the state from **that exact render**, not the future one.

6. **Think of event handlers like you think of JSX output**

   * Just as JSX reflects the current state, your event handlers "see" the same state. They behave consistently with what’s shown in the UI at that time.

7. **Event handlers keep the state from when they were created**

   * If you create a `setTimeout` inside an event handler, it will use the values of state and props **from the render when that handler was created**.
