
### ✅ **Interview Question:**

In the following React component, what will be the new value of the `counter` state if the user clicks the "add value" button once? Explain why.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(5)

  const addValue = () => {
     setCounter(counter + 1)
     setCounter(counter + 1)
     setCounter(counter + 1)
     setCounter(counter + 1)
  }

  return (
   <div>
     <h2>Counter Value: {counter}</h2>
     <button onClick={addValue}>Add Value</button>
   </div>
  )
}
```

* **A)** 6
* **B)** 9
* **C)** 8
* **D)** 10

### ✅ **Expected Answer:**

**Correct Answer: A) 6**

When the "Add Value" button is clicked, the function `addValue` runs `setCounter(counter + 1)` four times. However, React batches these state updates because they are using the **same value of `counter` from closure (i.e., 5)**.

React Fiber optimizes re-rendering by **batching multiple state updates** that occur in the same event loop. Since all `setCounter(counter + 1)` calls reference the same stale value of `counter` (which is 5), they all effectively become `setCounter(6)`. Therefore, the final value becomes `6`.

### ✅ **Follow-up Interview Question:**

How would you modify the `addValue` function so that the counter is incremented correctly by 4?

### ✅ **Expected Follow-up Answer:**

Use the **functional update form** of `setCounter` to access the latest state in each update:

```js
const addValue = () => {
   setCounter(prev => prev + 1)
   setCounter(prev => prev + 1)
   setCounter(prev => prev + 1)
   setCounter(prev => prev + 1)
}
```

This way, React will apply each update based on the most recent state, resulting in a final value of `9`.
