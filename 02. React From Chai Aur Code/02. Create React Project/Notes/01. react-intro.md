
# Let's break down the `"scripts"` section in your `package.json` file ‚Äî specifically this part:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

## ‚úÖ What is `"scripts"` in `package.json`?

* The `"scripts"` section defines **command aliases** you can run with:

  ```
  npm run <script-name>
  ```

  or

  ```
  yarn <script-name>
  ```

These scripts automate tasks like starting your development server, building your project, checking for code errors, etc.
