
## üìÅ What Is React Fiber?

* **React Fiber** is a complete **rewrite of React‚Äôs reconciliation algorithm** introduced in React 16.
* Its primary goal is to make React more suitable for animation, layout, gestures, and other performance-critical interactions.
* The headline feature: **incremental (or time-sliced) rendering** ‚Äî breaking work into small chunks that can be paused, reprioritized, aborted or resumed ([GitHub][1]).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fiber as a Unit of Work

* A **Fiber** is analogous to a **stack frame** ‚Äî representing a unit of work in the rendering process.
* Fiber nodes form a linked tree structure with properties:

  * `type`, `instanceNode`, `child`, `sibling`, `return`, `alternate`
  * `effectTag`: marks operations (Placement, Update, Delete)
* Two versions of each: **current** (already rendered) and **work‚Äëin‚Äëprogress (WIP)** ([Medium][2], [GitHub][3]).

---

## üß© Two‚ÄëPhase Rendering Model

### 1. **Render (Work) Phase ‚Äì Asynchronous**

* Builds the **Work‚Äëin‚ÄëProgress Tree** using:

  * `createWorkInProgress()`
  * `beginWork()`
  * `reconcileChildren()`
  * `completeWork()`
* Entirely side-effect‚Äëfree and interruptible ‚Äî can pause mid‚Äërender to handle higher‚Äëpriority tasks ([Medium][2]).

### 2. **Commit Phase ‚Äì Synchronous**

* Applies changes to the DOM based on `effectTag` flags.
* Swaps the WIP tree into current and flushes updates: **Placement, Update, Deletion** ([GitHub][3]).

---

## üîÅ Update Process Flow

1. State update triggers a new render cycle.
2. React locates the **root fiber** and builds a WIP tree (possibly cloning subtrees).
3. **beginWork** and **completeWork** run recursively, marking effects.
4. **Commit phase** applies changes and replaces the tree.
5. New current tree becomes the base for future updates ([Medium][4], [GitHub][3]).

---

## üéõÔ∏è Scheduling & Priority

* Fiber enables **prioritization**: handling urgent tasks like user input or animations before background updates (like data fetching).
* Allows React to **pause and resume** rendering based on browser frames (\~16ms), improving responsiveness and avoiding jank ([codingfizz][5], [LinkedIn][6]).

---

## üß† Hook Internals (v16.7+)

* Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`) are stored internally as a **linked list** on fiber nodes.
* During updates, Fiber coordinates between **current hooks** and **WIP hooks** to manage hook state and effects ([GitHub][3]).

---

## ü™ú Why Fiber Was Needed

* The older ‚Äústack‚Äëbased‚Äù reconciliation was synchronous and blocking ‚Äî large rendering work could freeze the UI.
* Fiber introduced:

  * **Interruptibility**
  * **Concurrency**
  * **Fine‚Äëgrained scheduling**
    These features enabled smoother animations and latency‚Äësensitive updates without rewriting the React API ([Medium][2], [rudraiitm.hashnode.dev][7]).

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept            | Purpose / Benefit                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fiber Node**     | Represents work unit (like virtual stack frame)    |
| **WIP vs Current** | Builds a new tree without touching live UI         |
| **Render Phase**   | Non-blocking, can pause/resume                     |
| **Commit Phase**   | Applies DOM changes synchronously                  |
| **Scheduling**     | Prioritizes urgent updates (e.g. input, animation) |
| **Hook Storage**   | Maintains hook state via Fiber linked list         |

## üìù Interview‚ÄëReady Answer

> ‚ÄúReact Fiber is the re‚Äëimplementation of React‚Äôs reconciliation engine introduced in React¬†16. It breaks rendering into small units of work (fibers), allowing React to **pause, prioritize, and resume rendering**, enabling smooth updates even during heavy UI work like animations. The architecture separates the rendering process into an asynchronous **render phase** (which builds a WIP tree) and a synchronous **commit phase** (which applies changes).
>
> Hooks state and side effects are maintained as linked lists on fiber nodes, ensuring updates are tracked and applied efficiently. Overall, Fiber provides **incremental rendering**, **concurrency**, and **prioritized updates**, making React responsive and suitable for complex UIs.‚Äù

## üßÅ Bonus: Example Metaphor

* Think of traditional React as a **single-threaded chef** who must finish cooking every dish before starting the next ‚Äî slow and unresponsive.
* Fiber transforms React into a **multi-tasking chef**: working on multiple dishes in small steps, interleaving work based on customer priority (e.g. appetizers first), pausing and resuming tasks to keep everything hot and served on time.
