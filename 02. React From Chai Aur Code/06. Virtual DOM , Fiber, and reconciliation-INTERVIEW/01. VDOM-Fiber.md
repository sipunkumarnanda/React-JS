# What is reconciliation?
- reconciliation The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
## update
- A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.

## ✅ What Is Virtual DOM (VDOM) in React?

The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the **real DOM**. It allows React to:

1. Render components to a virtual structure (a JS object tree).
2. Compare the new VDOM with the previous one using **diffing**.
3. Update only the parts of the actual DOM that changed (called **reconciliation**).

This makes UI updates **faster and more efficient**, especially for large apps.

## 🧠 Is Virtual DOM Still Used Today?

### ✅ Yes, but with **improved architecture**:

* React still uses the **Virtual DOM model** as the foundation of its rendering.
* However, React 16+ uses the **Fiber architecture** to manage how it **builds, updates, and reconciles** the VDOM.

So VDOM is not **replaced** — it’s **evolved**.

## 🆕 Fiber vs Old VDOM

| Feature        | Old VDOM Model        | Fiber (React 16+)                             |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Rendering      | Synchronous, blocking | **Interruptible, time-sliced, async**         |
| Data structure | Tree of objects       | **Fiber nodes** with priority, effects, etc.  |
| Update control | All at once           | **Granular control over updates**             |
| Scheduling     | Not possible          | **Built-in scheduler** for prioritizing tasks |

So React **still creates and uses** a VDOM, but now it's part of a smarter system (Fiber) that:

* Breaks work into small units
* Prioritizes updates
* Improves responsiveness (especially for animations, inputs, etc.)

## 🚀 Bonus: React 18+ with Concurrent Features

React 18 introduces **concurrent rendering**, which:

* Builds upon the VDOM
* Allows updates to be **deferred**, **interrupted**, or **batched**
* Makes user interfaces more responsive without changing the VDOM model

> So the **Virtual DOM is still central**, but it's now supported by Fiber and Concurrent Mode to make modern React more powerful and efficient.

## 🧾 Summary for Interview

> “Yes, Virtual DOM is still used in React today. It's the core idea behind how React tracks and updates the UI efficiently. But with the introduction of React Fiber (in React 16), the way React handles Virtual DOM updates has become more advanced — allowing interruptible, prioritized rendering. React 18 builds on this with concurrent features, but the Virtual DOM remains an essential concept.”
