
## 🎯 **What Are Hooks in React?**

> **Hooks** are built-in functions in React that let us use **state**, **lifecycle methods**, and **other React features** inside **functional components** — something that was only possible in class components before.

## ❓ Why Were Hooks Introduced?

Before hooks, we used **class components** to manage:

* State (`this.state`)
* Lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc.)
* Refs and context

But that caused **three major problems**:

### 🚫 Problems Before Hooks

| Problem                                     | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **Boilerplate & Complex Syntax**         | Class components required `this`, constructors, and binding, making code verbose and harder to read.                        |
| 🧩 **Code Reuse Was Hard**                  | Sharing logic across components meant using HOCs or render props — which caused **wrapper hell** and made debugging harder. |
| 🔀 **Logic Scattered in Lifecycle Methods** | Related logic was spread across `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.                     |

## ✅ How Hooks Solve These Problems

| Feature                             | How Hooks Help                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧼 **Simpler Syntax**               | Hooks work in **functional components**, no `this`, no constructors, less boilerplate.             |
| ♻️ **Code Reuse with Custom Hooks** | We can extract logic into **custom hooks** and reuse across components cleanly.                    |
| 🧠 **Better Logic Organization**    | Side-effects, subscriptions, timers, etc., go into `useEffect`, keeping logic focused and grouped. |

## 🔑 Most Common Hooks (with examples to remember)

### 1. `useState` – to store and update data

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

> Remember: Think of `useState` as replacing `this.state` in a functional component.

---

### 2. `useEffect` – to run side effects like API calls, subscriptions

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // runs on mount
}, []);
```

> It's a **combination of** `componentDidMount`, `DidUpdate`, and `WillUnmount`.

---

### 3. `useContext` – to consume global state (context API)

```jsx
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

> Avoids prop drilling, like `this.context` in class components.

---

### 4. `useRef` – to access DOM elements or persist values

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
```

> Think of `useRef` like a hidden box that doesn’t cause re-renders.

---

### 5. `useCallback` / `useMemo` – for performance optimization

```jsx
const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => doSomething(), []);
```

> Prevents unnecessary function or value recalculations on every render.

## 🧠 Interview-Ready Summary

> React Hooks were introduced to **simplify component logic**, allow **state and side effects in functional components**, and **promote code reuse** with custom hooks. They eliminate the complexity of class components and offer a more **elegant, modular** way to write React code.

## 💡 Example Hook-Based Answer in an Interview

> "Hooks in React let us use features like state, context, and side effects inside functional components. Before hooks, we had to use class components to manage state and lifecycle methods, which led to complex syntax, harder code reuse, and scattered logic. Hooks solve this by providing a cleaner, more reusable, and functional approach to component development — especially with tools like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks."
