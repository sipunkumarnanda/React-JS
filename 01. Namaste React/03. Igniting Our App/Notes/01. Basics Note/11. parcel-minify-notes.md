**Minification** is the process of removing unnecessary characters from code (like spaces, comments, newlines) without changing its functionality. This helps reduce file size and improves website/app loading speed.

#### What Does Parcel Do?

* When you run a Parcel build command like:

  ```bash
  npx parcel build index.html
  ```

  Parcel prepares your app for production by optimizing your files.

* Part of this optimization is **minification** — it automatically minifies your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.

#### How Does Parcel Minify?

1. **JavaScript Minification:**

   * Parcel uses a popular minifier called **Terser** (a fork of UglifyJS) by default.
   * Terser removes whitespace, comments, shortens variable names, and simplifies code syntax.
   * It also performs some optimizations like dead code elimination (removes code that will never run).

2. **CSS Minification:**

   * Parcel uses CSS minifiers like **cssnano**.
   * It removes comments, unnecessary spaces, and optimizes CSS rules.

3. **HTML Minification:**

   * Parcel also minifies HTML by removing extra spaces, line breaks, and comments.

#### Why Minification Matters

* Smaller file size → faster download by browsers → faster page load times.
* Improves performance, especially on slower networks or devices.
* Makes it harder for others to read your code (though not a security measure).

### Example:

Before minification:

```js
function greet(name) {
    // This function greets the user
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("World");
```

After minification (Terser output):

```js
function greet(o){console.log("Hello, "+o+"!")}greet("World");
```

### Summary

* **Parcel automatically minifies your code** during production builds.
* It uses tools like **Terser** for JS, **cssnano** for CSS, and HTML minifiers.
* Minification removes unnecessary characters and optimizes your code without changing functionality.
* This results in smaller bundle sizes and better performance.
