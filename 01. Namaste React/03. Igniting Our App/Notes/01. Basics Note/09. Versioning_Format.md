
## ✅ Versioning Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

Example: `1.2.3`

* **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
* **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
* **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

---

## 🔁 Version Prefixes and What They Mean

### 1. `^` (Caret) → *Allow updates that do not change the first non-zero number (usually MAJOR)*

```json
"react": "^18.2.0"
```

* Can install: `18.2.1`, `18.3.0`, but **not** `19.0.0`
* Use Case: You trust **minor and patch updates** are safe (most common)

📌 **Analogy**: "Update as long as you stay in the same room (major version). You can repaint or rearrange furniture (minor/patch), but don’t change houses."

---

### 2. `~` (Tilde) → *Allow patch-level updates only*

```json
"react": "~18.2.0"
```

* Can install: `18.2.1`, `18.2.5` but **not** `18.3.0`
* Use Case: You trust **bug fixes** but don’t want new features.

📌 **Analogy**: "Only fix cracks in the wall, don’t add new furniture or repaint."

---

### 3. No Symbol → *Use exact version*

```json
"react": "18.2.0"
```

* Will **only install** `18.2.0`, no auto updates.
* Use Case: Fully locked dependencies for reproducibility.

📌 **Analogy**: "Don’t change anything — freeze the setup exactly."

---

### 4. `>` / `<` / `>=` / `<=` → *Comparison operators*

```json
"react": ">17.0.0"
```

* Will install any version greater than `17.0.0`
* Can be used for custom ranges

---

### 5. Wildcards `*`, `x`

```json
"react": "*"
"react": "18.x"
```

* `*` allows **any version**
* `18.x` allows **any minor or patch in 18**

📌 Dangerous if you don’t want uncontrolled updates.
