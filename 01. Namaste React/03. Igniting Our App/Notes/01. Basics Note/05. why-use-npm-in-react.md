We use **npm** because we need to manage lots of packages. Our React app is a large application that doesn't run on React alone â€” it requires many additional features and "superpowers." These superpowers come from various packages, and these packages are provided and managed using **npm**.

### âœ… Why Do We Use `npm`?

We use `npm` (Node Package Manager) because modern React applications are large and rely on **many additional functionalities** beyond just React itself.

A React app doesn't work with only React â€” we often need **extra powers** like:

* Routing (e.g., `react-router-dom`)
* State management (e.g., `redux`)
* Styling (e.g., `tailwindcss`, `styled-components`)
* Development tools (e.g., `parcel`, `webpack`, `babel`)
* HTTP requests (e.g., `axios`)

These additional tools and features come from **external packages**.

`npm` helps us:

* Install and manage all these packages efficiently
* Keep track of their versions
* Handle their dependencies
* Run scripts to build, start, or test our app

> ðŸ’¡ **In short:**
> `npm` acts as the manager of all the powerful tools (packages) that your React app depends on.
