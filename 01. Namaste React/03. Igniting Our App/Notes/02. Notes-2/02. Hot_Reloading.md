
## 🔁 What is Hot Reloading (Hot Module Replacement - HMR)?

**Hot Reloading** or **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is a feature that **automatically updates the changed parts of your code in the browser without doing a full page reload**.

### 📌 Key Benefits:

* **Preserves app state** (like form inputs, scroll position, Redux state).
* **Faster development** cycle.
* Immediate feedback loop → improves developer productivity.

## 🔧 How Hot Reloading Works in Parcel

### 🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **File Watcher Watches All Files**

   * Parcel uses a **high-performance file watcher** (written in C++).
   * It continuously **monitors your source files** (JS, CSS, HTML, etc.) for any change.

2. **When You Save a File (Code Change Happens)**:

   * The file watcher detects a change.
   * Parcel knows **exactly which module/file** was modified.
   * It triggers the internal **build pipeline** only for that file (not the whole project).

3. **Parcel Sends an Update Signal via WebSocket**

   * A **WebSocket connection** is maintained between the Parcel dev server and your browser.
   * As soon as Parcel rebuilds the updated module:

     * It **sends the updated module to the browser** using the WebSocket.
     * No need to reload the whole HTML page.

4. **HMR Runtime Applies the Update**

   * Parcel injects a **small runtime script** into your app during development.
   * This runtime:

     * Listens for update signals from the server.
     * Dynamically **replaces the changed module in memory**.
     * Triggers only the parts of the app that depend on that module.

## 🔍 Example:

Imagine you change a function in `math.js`:

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

When you save:

* Parcel's file watcher detects that `math.js` changed.
* Parcel rebuilds **just `math.js`**.
* It sends the updated version of that module to the browser.
* The HMR runtime **hot swaps** the updated function in your running app.

## ❗Note:

If a module **can’t be replaced safely**, Parcel will **fallback to a full page reload** to maintain correctness (e.g., if the module has side effects or no HMR support).

## 🔐 Bonus: Why Parcel is Efficient at HMR?

* Tracks dependencies between modules (Dependency Graph).
* Uses fast, native watchers.
* Uses content hashing to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
* Injects precise code into the browser rather than reloading everything.
