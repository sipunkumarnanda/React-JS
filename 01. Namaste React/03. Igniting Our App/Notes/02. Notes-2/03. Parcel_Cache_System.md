
## 📦 What is `.parcel-cache`?

### ✅ **Definition:**

`.parcel-cache` is a **hidden directory** automatically created by **Parcel bundler** during development and build processes.
It stores **intermediate build artifacts**, **metadata**, and **dependency graphs** to **speed up future builds**.

## 🚀 Why is `.parcel-cache` Important?

### Imagine This:

Without a cache, every time you run the Parcel build or dev server:

* Parcel would recompile **everything from scratch**.
* This leads to **slow builds** even if only one file changed.

### With `.parcel-cache`:

Parcel stores processed results so that **only the changed files need to be rebuilt** — making subsequent builds much **faster and more efficient**.

## 🧠 What Does `.parcel-cache` Contain?

Here's what it typically stores:

| Folder/File              | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `caches/`                | Transpiled modules, minified JS/CSS, parsed files    |
| `graph/`                 | Dependency graph (tracks how files are related)      |
| `blob/`                  | Intermediate file representations (e.g. after Babel) |
| `content-v1/`, `v3/`     | Versioned content hashed modules                     |
| `.meta` / manifest files | Metadata for caching and optimization                |

## 🔁 When is it Used?

* ✅ During **`parcel serve`** (dev server)
* ✅ During **`parcel build`**
* ✅ When using **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
* ✅ To **skip unchanged files** in builds

## 🧹 Can You Delete `.parcel-cache`?

Yes — and sometimes you **should**, especially when:

* You're encountering strange build issues.
* Cache becomes outdated or corrupted.
* You want a completely fresh build.

> Run:

```bash
rm -rf .parcel-cache
```

Parcel will automatically regenerate it the next time you build or serve your project.

## 🧰 Does It Go in Version Control?

**❌ No!** You should **not commit `.parcel-cache` to Git** or any VCS.

📌 Add this to `.gitignore`:

```txt
