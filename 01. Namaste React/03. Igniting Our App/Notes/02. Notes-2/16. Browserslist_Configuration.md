
# ðŸ“‹ What is Browserslist?

**Browserslist** is a configuration tool used in frontend development to specify which browsers your project should support.

It helps tools like **Babel**, **Autoprefixer**, **PostCSS**, **Webpack**, and **Parcel** understand which browsers to target when transforming and optimizing your code.

---

## Why is Browserslist Important?

Different browsers support different JavaScript and CSS features. Some features need to be **transpiled** or **polyfilled** for older browsers, while modern browsers can run the code as-is.

By defining your target browsers with Browserslist, you can:

* **Optimize your build** by only including necessary polyfills and prefixes.
* Ensure consistent behavior across different browsers.
* Reduce bundle size by avoiding unnecessary code for browsers you donâ€™t support.

---

## How Browserslist Works

You define your browser targets using queries such as:

* `> 1%` â€” Browsers with more than 1% market share
* `last 2 versions` â€” Last 2 versions of each browser
* `not dead` â€” Excludes browsers without official support or updates
* `IE 11` â€” Internet Explorer 11 specifically

These queries are interpreted by tools to decide how to process your code.

## How to Use Browserslist

### 1. Define Browserslist Configuration

Browserslist configuration can be specified in several ways:

* **In `package.json`**

```json
"browserslist": [
  "> 1%",
  "last 2 versions",
  "not dead"
]
```

* **In a separate `.browserslistrc` file**

```
> 1%
last 2 versions
not dead
```

* **In other config files** depending on your tooling.

### 2. Example Usage with Babel and Autoprefixer

* Babel uses Browserslist to decide which JavaScript features need to be transpiled.
* Autoprefixer uses it to add CSS vendor prefixes only where necessary.

### 3. Check Your Browserslist Configuration

You can run:

```bash
npx browserslist
```

To see exactly which browsers your queries resolve to, based on current usage data.
