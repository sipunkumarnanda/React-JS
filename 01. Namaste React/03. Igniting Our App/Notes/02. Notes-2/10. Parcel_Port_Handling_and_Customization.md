---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Default Port: `1234`**

* When you run `npx parcel index.html`, Parcel automatically starts a **development server** on port `1234`.
* So, your local site runs at:

  ```
  http://localhost:1234
  ```

---

## üß† 2. **Port Collision Handling (Smart Port Resolution)**

* If port `1234` is already in use (e.g., by another app or another instance of Parcel), Parcel doesn‚Äôt crash.
* Instead, Parcel **automatically finds the next available port**, such as `1235`, `1236`, etc.
* You'll see a message like:

  ```
  üö® Port 1234 is in use, using port 1235 instead
  ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Custom Port (Using CLI Option)**

You can manually specify the port using the `--port` flag:

```bash
npx parcel index.html --port 3000
```

* This tells Parcel to run the development server at:

  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```

* Helpful when you want to:

  * Avoid conflicts
  * Match backend server ports
  * Integrate with specific dev workflows

## üåê 4. **Why Port Management Matters**

Parcel‚Äôs smart port handling:

* Avoids crashes and port conflicts.
* Makes it developer-friendly ‚Äî you don't need to manually free ports.
* Keeps the local development server flexible and reliable.

## üîê 5. With HTTPS

When using the `--https` flag, port `1234` is still used by default, but the protocol is secured:

```bash
npx parcel index.html --https
```

Result:

```
https://localhost:1234
```

You can combine both `--port` and `--https`:

```bash
npx parcel index.html --https --port 3001
```

## Summary Table

| Scenario            | Result                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Default port        | `http://localhost:1234`         |
| Port in use         | Parcel finds the next open port |
| Manually set port   | `--port <PORT>`                 |
| Use HTTPS           | `--https` (uses `https://`)     |
| HTTPS + custom port | `--https --port <PORT>`         |
