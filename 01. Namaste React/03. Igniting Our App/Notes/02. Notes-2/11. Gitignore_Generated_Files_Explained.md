# üóÇÔ∏è What is `.gitignore`?

* `.gitignore` is a special file used by Git to **ignore files and directories** when committing to a repository.
* Any file or folder listed inside `.gitignore` will **not be tracked or uploaded** to your GitHub repository (unless forced).

# üîÅ Why Ignore "Generated" Files?

> ‚ùó Files that can be **re-generated automatically** should not be pushed to version control.

## ‚úÖ Examples of Generated Files (Should Be Ignored)

| Folder/File      | Why Ignore?                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dist/`          | Parcel/Webpack output folder for production builds (re-generated anytime)  |
| `.parcel-cache/` | Parcel‚Äôs internal cache to speed up builds (not needed for source control) |
| `node_modules/`  | Contains 3rd-party dependencies; reinstalled with `npm install`            |
| `*.log`          | Logs generated during build/runtime; not needed in repo                    |
| `build/`         | Common build output folder (e.g., from React, Vue)                         |
| `.env.local`     | Contains sensitive or dev-specific config                                  |

### ‚ú® Why We Ignore These:

* They are **machine-generated**, not hand-written by developers.
* They **bloat** the repository with unnecessary files.
* They **change frequently** and create messy diffs in version control.
* They can be **recreated by anyone** using project instructions (e.g., `npm install`, `npm run build`).

## ‚úÖ What to Keep in Git?

| Should be Committed                                | Reason                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`, `main.js`                            | Your actual source code                 |
| `package.json` & `package-lock.json`               | Needed to install dependencies          |
| `.gitignore`                                       | Rules for ignoring files                |
| `.env.example`                                     | Safe template for environment variables |
| Config files (e.g. `.babelrc`, `parcel.config.js`) | Needed for consistent builds            |

## üìù Example `.gitignore` for a Parcel Project

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Parcel cache
.parcel-cache/

# Build output
dist/

# Log files
*.log

# Environment variables
.env
```

## üîÅ Summary

* **"Generated files"** are those created during build or runtime (not written by you).
* These files **should be ignored** using `.gitignore`.
* This keeps your repo **clean, efficient, and focused only on the real source code.**
