---

## 📦 1. **How is `node_modules/` Generated?**

### 🧠 What is it?

* `node_modules/` is the directory where **all your project’s dependencies** (installed from NPM) are stored.

### 🛠 How to Generate It:

> Just run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 📌 What Happens:

* Reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
* Downloads all listed dependencies from the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Installs them into the `node_modules/` folder.
* Now your code can import and use those libraries.

---

## 📁 Example:

### Your `package.json` might include:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

> After running `npm install`, you will see a `node_modules/` folder appear.

## 🏗️ 2. **How is `dist/` Generated?**

### 🧠 What is it?

* `dist/` (short for "distribution") is the **build output** folder.
* It contains **production-ready files**: minified HTML, JS, CSS, optimized images, etc.
* Created by bundlers like **Parcel**, **Webpack**, etc.

---

### 🛠 How to Generate It with Parcel:

> Run:

```bash
npx parcel build index.html
```

### 📌 What Happens:

* Parcel starts a **production build** process:

  * Bundles JS, CSS, HTML.
  * Minifies files.
  * Optimizes assets (like images).
  * Outputs final build to `dist/` directory.
* Now the `dist/` folder contains everything ready to be deployed to a server or hosted on the web.

---

## 🧪 For Development (Hot Reloading):

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

* Parcel creates a temporary `dist` in memory or disk for dev preview.
* Doesn't always persist it unless explicitly configured or built.
