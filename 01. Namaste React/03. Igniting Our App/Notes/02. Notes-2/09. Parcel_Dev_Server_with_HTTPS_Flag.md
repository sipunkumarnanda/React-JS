
# what happens when you run:

```
npx parcel index.html --https
```

# Explanation of `npx parcel index.html --https`

---

## 1. **`npx parcel index.html`**

* As before, this starts the Parcel development server, serving your project starting from `index.html`.
* It creates a local web server (default port 1234) to serve your app for development.
* Supports bundling, hot module replacement, file watching, etc.

---

## 2. **Adding `--https` Flag**

* The `--https` option tells Parcel to **serve your local development server over HTTPS instead of HTTP**.
* This means:

  * The server uses **SSL/TLS encryption**.
  * Your browser connects securely via `https://localhost:1234` rather than `http://localhost:1234`.

---

## Why Use HTTPS in Development?

* Some web APIs require **secure contexts** (HTTPS) to work:

  * Examples: Geolocation API, Service Workers, Web Bluetooth, Notifications, etc.
* Testing HTTPS locally ensures your app behaves the same as in production where HTTPS is mandatory.
* Helps catch HTTPS-related issues early.

## How Parcel Handles HTTPS

* Parcel **generates a self-signed SSL certificate** automatically.
* When you access `https://localhost:1234` in your browser:

  * The browser will likely show a **warning** because the certificate is self-signed (not from a trusted authority).
  * You can **bypass the warning for local development**.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx parcel index.html` | Starts Parcel dev server serving your app               |
| `--https`               | Enables HTTPS protocol on the dev server                |
| Self-signed SSL cert    | Parcel creates a local SSL certificate for HTTPS        |
| Browser warning         | Self-signed cert causes browser warning (normal in dev) |
| Secure context          | Allows testing HTTPS-only APIs and features locally     |
