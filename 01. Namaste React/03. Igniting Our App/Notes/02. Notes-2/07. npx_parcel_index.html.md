
# What Happens When You Run `npx parcel index.html`

---

## 1. **`npx` Runs Parcel Without Global Installation**

* `npx` is a tool that runs npm packages without needing them installed globally.
* When you type `npx parcel index.html`, it runs the **Parcel bundler** directly using the local or latest version from npm.

---

## 2. **Parcel Starts a Development Server**

* Parcel reads your `index.html` as the **entry point**.
* It starts a **local development server** (usually at `http://localhost:1234` by default).
* This server serves your app **live in the browser**.

---

## 3. **Parcel Parses and Analyzes Your Project**

* Parcel looks at your `index.html` and **all linked assets** like JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc.
* It builds a **dependency graph** to understand all files your project needs.

---

## 4. **Bundling & Transformations**

* Parcel **bundles all your code and assets** into optimized chunks.
* It applies transformations based on file type:

  * Transpiling modern JS (Babel)
  * Compiling CSS preprocessors (Sass, Less)
  * Optimizing images
* In development mode, Parcel skips heavy minification for faster rebuilds.

## 5. **File Watching & Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**

* Parcel watches your files for any changes.
* When you edit a file, Parcel **automatically rebuilds** only the changed parts.
* It pushes updates to the browser **without full page reload** â€” called Hot Module Replacement.
* This speeds up development by keeping app state and instantly showing changes.

---

## 6. **Serving the App**

* Parcel serves your bundled app over HTTP.
* You open `http://localhost:1234` in your browser to see your app live.
* All your code, assets, and dependencies are served by this dev server.
