
### What is the `dist` Folder?

* The `dist` folder (short for **distribution**) is a directory created by build tools like Webpack, Parcel, or other bundlers.
* It contains the **final production-ready files** of your project, such as:

  * Bundled JavaScript files
  * Minified CSS
  * Optimized images
  * Other static assets needed to run your app

### Purpose of the `dist` Folder

* It holds the **compiled and optimized version** of your source code, ready to be deployed to a web server or delivered to users.
* The files inside are usually:

  * Minified (compressed to reduce size)
  * Transpiled (converted from modern JavaScript/TypeScript to browser-compatible code)
  * Bundled (all modules combined into fewer files for performance)

### Important Notes

* You **do not write code directly** in the `dist` folder; it is generated automatically by your build process.
* Itâ€™s common to add the `dist` folder to `.gitignore` because the source code should be version controlled, not the generated output.
* When deploying, you upload the contents of `dist` to your server or hosting platform.

**Summary:**
`dist` contains the optimized, ready-to-serve build output of your project created by build tools.
