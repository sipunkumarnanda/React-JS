
### 🛠️ What is `npx`?

`npx` is a command-line tool that comes **bundled with Node.js** (since version 5.2.0 of `npm`). It allows you to **run Node packages without installing them globally**.

---

### 🔍 In Simple Words:

`npx` lets you **execute any npm package directly**, even if it's not installed globally on your system.

---

### 💡 Why do we need `npx`?

Without `npx`:

* You must install a package globally to use its CLI

  ```bash
  npm install -g create-react-app
  create-react-app my-app
  ```

With `npx`:

* You **run it directly**, no need for global installation

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```

This avoids:

* Global clutter
* Version conflicts
* Unnecessary installations

### 🚀 When to Use `npx`?

| Use Case                            | Example                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 🏁 Create a React app               | `npx create-react-app my-app` |
| 📦 Run a local project tool         | `npx eslint src/`             |
| 🧪 Test a package before installing | `npx cowsay "Hello"`          |
| 🧹 Run a one-time script            | `npx kill-port 3000`          |

---

### ⚙️ How it Works Internally

1. Checks if the package exists locally in `node_modules/.bin`
2. If not found, it **downloads it temporarily**, runs it, and removes it
3. Uses the **latest version** unless specified otherwise
