
### 📦 What is `.parcel-cache`?

`.parcel-cache` is a **hidden folder automatically created by Parcel** (the bundler) when you run a Parcel project.

---

### 📁 Purpose of `.parcel-cache`:

It stores **intermediate build artifacts** to make your builds faster.

Think of it as a **smart memory**:
Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch every time, Parcel checks what has changed and only rebuilds that part.

---

### 🧠 Why is it needed?

Parcel performs tasks like:

* Compiling JavaScript
* Transpiling TypeScript or Babel
* Optimizing images, CSS, etc.

All these operations take time. So Parcel:

* Saves the processed results in `.parcel-cache`
* **Skips re-processing unchanged files**
* **Speeds up rebuilds and hot reloads**
