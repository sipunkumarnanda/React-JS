
### **package.json**

* **Purpose:**
  It’s the main configuration file for your Node.js project. It lists your project’s metadata, scripts, and most importantly, the **dependencies** your project requires.

* **What it contains:**

  * Project name, version, description
  * Scripts to run commands (like `start`, `build`, `test`)
  * Dependency packages with version ranges (e.g., `"react": "^18.0.0"`)
  * Dev dependencies for development only
  * Other configuration info like repository, license, author, etc.

* **Role:**
  When you run `npm install`, `package.json` tells npm what packages your project depends on.

### **package-lock.json**

* **Purpose:**
  It locks the exact versions of dependencies (and their dependencies) installed in your project, creating a reproducible build environment.

* **What it contains:**

  * Exact package versions installed
  * The full dependency tree with resolved versions
  * Integrity hashes to verify package content

* **Role:**
  Ensures that everyone who installs the project gets the **same versions** of dependencies, avoiding “works on my machine” problems.

* **Automatically generated:**
  Created or updated automatically when you run `npm install` or modify dependencies.

**In short:**
`package.json` declares *what* packages you want, and `package-lock.json` locks down *exactly which versions* got installed.
