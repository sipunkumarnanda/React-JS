**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is a feature in modern development tools like **Webpack**, **Vite**, and **Parcel** that allows **updating modules in a running application without a full page reload**.

---

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

When you're developing an app and you **change some code** (e.g., update a React component), HMR lets the browser **only update that specific part**—without refreshing the entire page.

This means:

* You keep the **application state** (e.g., form data, scroll position).
* Updates are **faster and smoother** during development.

### 📦 How HMR Works:

1. **Watcher**: The dev server watches your files for changes.
2. **Compiler**: When a file changes, only that module is **recompiled**.
3. **Push**: The new version is **pushed to the browser via WebSocket**.
4. **Apply**: The browser **injects the new code** into the running app.
5. **No Reload**: No full refresh—only the modified parts are updated.

### 🖼️ Visual Example:

Imagine you have a React button:

```js
function Button() {
  return <button>Click Me</button>;
}
```

You change it to:

```js
function Button() {
  return <button>Submit</button>;
}
```

With **HMR**, only this button is re-rendered in the browser. Everything else (like a form or stateful inputs) remains untouched.

### ✅ Benefits of HMR:

* 💡 Keeps your app state intact.
* ⚡ Very fast development feedback loop.
* 🔄 Instant UI updates.
* 💻 Smooth developer experience.

---

### ⚠️ HMR Is for Development Only

In **production**, HMR is disabled. Instead, the whole application is bundled and loaded fresh.

### 🛠️ Supported By:

* **Webpack** (via `webpack-dev-server`)
* **Vite**
* **Parcel**
* **Next.js** and many modern React/JS frameworks
