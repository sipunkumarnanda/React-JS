In a Node.js project (especially React or any frontend framework), `package.json` manages project dependencies. Two important keys here are:

---

### ✅ `dependencies`

These are the **packages required for your project to run in production**.
They are essential for the app’s core functionality.

#### 🔧 Examples:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "axios": "^1.4.0"
}
```

#### 💡 Use When:

* The package is **needed during runtime**.
* Your code **imports or uses it directly**.

#### 📦 Installed via:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

---

### 🔨 `devDependencies`

These are the **packages only needed during development** — like testing tools, bundlers, linters, formatters, etc.

#### 🧪 Examples:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "eslint": "^8.38.0",
  "parcel": "^2.9.3",
  "jest": "^29.5.0"
}
```

#### 💡 Use When:

* It’s needed **only for building, testing, or development**, not at runtime.
* These tools are **not shipped to production**.

#### 📦 Installed via:

```bash
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```

### 🆚 Key Differences

| Feature               | `dependencies`        | `devDependencies`          |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Used in production?   | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                       |
| Bundled in final app? | ✅ Yes (e.g., `react`) | ❌ No (e.g., `eslint`)      |
| Installed on deploy?  | ✅ Yes                 | 🚫 Often skipped in deploy |
| Install command       | `npm install`         | `npm install --save-dev`   |

### 🚀 Real-World Analogy:

* `dependencies`: Tools and materials **used to build and ship the house**.
* `devDependencies`: Scaffolding and measuring tape **used during construction**, but **not left behind**.
