
### Why Should You Not Modify `package-lock.json` Manually?

* **Automatically Managed:**
  The `package-lock.json` file is **automatically generated and updated** by npm whenever you install, update, or remove packages. It reflects the exact versions and dependency tree that npm resolved.

* **Ensures Consistency:**
  Manually editing it can break the integrity of the dependency tree, causing mismatches between installed packages and what’s recorded. This defeats the purpose of having a lock file that ensures everyone uses the exact same dependency versions.

* **Risk of Errors:**
  Manual changes can introduce syntax errors or invalid configurations that break your package installation or runtime behavior.

* **Best Practice:**
  Always let npm manage `package-lock.json`. To update it, run proper npm commands like `npm install` or `npm update` instead of editing it by hand.

**In short:**
Modify dependencies only through npm commands — never manually edit `package-lock.json` to maintain consistency, correctness, and prevent unexpected bugs.
