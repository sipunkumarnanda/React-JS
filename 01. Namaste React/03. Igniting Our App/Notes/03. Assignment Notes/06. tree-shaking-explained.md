
### 🌳 What is **Tree Shaking**?

**Tree Shaking** is a **dead code elimination** technique used in modern JavaScript bundlers like **Webpack**, **Rollup**, and **Parcel** to remove **unused (or unimported) code** from the final production bundle.

### 🔍 In-Depth Explanation:

#### ✅ **Why is it called Tree Shaking?**

Think of your code as a tree:

* The **entire codebase** is the tree.
* **Used/imported modules** are the visible branches.
* **Unused code** are like dead leaves and hidden branches.

👉 When the tree is shaken during the build process, the dead (unused) parts fall off = smaller, faster bundles.

### 🧠 **How It Works:**

1. **ES6 Module System (ESM):**

   * Tree shaking **only works** with **ES6 `import/export`** syntax.
   * CommonJS (`require`) is not tree-shakeable because of its dynamic nature.

2. **Static Analysis:**

   * The bundler statically analyzes the import/export structure.
   * Removes functions, classes, variables **not referenced anywhere**.

### 📦 Example:

#### `utils.js`

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

#### `app.js`

```js
import { add } from './utils';

console.log(add(2, 3));
```

🧹 Here, the `multiply` function is never used. During tree shaking, it will be **excluded** from the final bundle.

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

* ✅ Works best in **production mode** (`npm run build`) with bundlers like Webpack.
* ❌ Avoid dynamic imports/exports for effective tree shaking.
* ✅ Keep code modular—split into smaller, exportable pieces.

---

### ✅ Benefits:

* Reduces bundle size.
* Improves performance (especially initial load time).
* Eliminates dead code automatically.
