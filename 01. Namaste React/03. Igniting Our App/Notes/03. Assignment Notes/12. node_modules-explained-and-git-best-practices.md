
### What is `node_modules`?

* `node_modules` is the folder where **all the installed packages and their dependencies** for a Node.js project are stored.
* When you run `npm install`, npm downloads the packages listed in `package.json` and places them inside `node_modules`.
* This folder can contain thousands of files and can be very large.

### Should You Push `node_modules` to Git?

**No, it is generally a bad idea to push `node_modules` to Git.**

**Reasons:**

1. **Huge Size:**
   The folder is often very large, which bloats your repository and slows down Git operations.

2. **Redundancy:**
   The packages can be restored anytime using `npm install` based on `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

3. **Platform/Environment Differences:**
   Some packages have platform-specific binaries; pushing `node_modules` can cause issues across different environments.

4. **Best Practice:**
   Add `node_modules` to `.gitignore` so itâ€™s excluded from version control. Instead, rely on the lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) for exact dependencies.

**Summary:**
Always exclude `node_modules` from Git and use `npm install` to recreate it locally.
