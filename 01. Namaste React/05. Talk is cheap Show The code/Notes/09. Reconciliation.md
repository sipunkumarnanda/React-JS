
## 🔄 What Is Reconciliation in React?

- ### React uses a diffing algorithm to find the differences between virtual DOM trees. It determines what needs to be updated and then efficiently updates and renders those changes to the actual DOM.

---

**Reconciliation** is the **process React uses to update the DOM efficiently** when a component’s state or props change.

> In simple terms:
> **Reconciliation = Comparing virtual DOM trees → updating the real DOM minimally.**

## 🧠 Why Reconciliation?

The browser DOM is slow to update. So instead of updating everything blindly, React:

1. Maintains a **virtual DOM** (a lightweight in-memory tree).
2. When changes happen (e.g., `setState`), React creates a **new virtual DOM**.
3. Then it **compares** the new virtual DOM to the **previous one**.
4. It **calculates the minimal set of changes** (called "diffing").
5. Then React updates **only the changed parts** in the real DOM.

## ⚙️ How Does Reconciliation Work?

### Step-by-Step:

1. You call `setState()` or a prop changes.
2. React re-renders the component → generates a **new virtual DOM tree**.
3. React **diffs** (compares) the old virtual DOM and the new one.
4. React identifies what has changed:

   * Text changes
   * Elements added/removed
   * Attributes changed
5. React performs **DOM updates** only where necessary.

## 🔬 Example

### Before State Change:

```jsx
<h1>Hello, Alice</h1>
```

### After State Change:

```jsx
<h1>Hello, Bob</h1>
```

React sees:

* Same element (`<h1>`)
* But the text content changed

👉 React updates **only the text node** — not the whole DOM tree.

## 🧩 Rules React Uses During Reconciliation

### 1. **Different element types → full replacement**

```jsx
<div>...</div> → <span>...</span>
// React replaces the entire DOM node
```

### 2. **Same element type → compare props and children**

```jsx
<button disabled={true} /> → <button disabled={false} />
// React just updates the `disabled` attribute
```

### 3. **Keys are critical in lists**

React uses `key` props to track items in lists efficiently.

```jsx
const list = items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
```

Without keys, React may re-render entire subtrees unnecessarily.

## 🔄 Reconciliation vs Diffing

* **Diffing** is the **algorithm** React uses to compare two virtual DOM trees.
* **Reconciliation** is the **overall process**:

  * Triggered by changes
  * Renders new VDOM
  * Diffs it
  * Updates the real DOM

So, **diffing is part of reconciliation**.

---

## 🧠 Optimization: React's Assumptions

To make reconciliation fast, React:

* Assumes **components of different types** produce different trees.
* Uses **keys** in lists to track movement/reordering.
* Only compares **same-type elements** deeply.

These assumptions make React’s reconciliation **O(n)** in most cases (linear time).

| Reconciliation | React’s process for updating the DOM efficiently |

| Triggered by   | `setState()`, props change, context change, etc. |

## 📌 Real-World Analogy

Imagine rewriting an essay. Instead of deleting the whole thing and starting over (full re-render), you use **track changes** to update only what’s different. That’s reconciliation.
