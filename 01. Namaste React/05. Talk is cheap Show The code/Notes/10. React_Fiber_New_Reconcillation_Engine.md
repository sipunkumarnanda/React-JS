
## ⚙️ What is React Fiber?

**React Fiber** is a **complete rewrite of React's reconciliation algorithm**, introduced in **React 16**. It allows React to **break work into units**, prioritize updates, pause and resume rendering, and deliver **smoother and more responsive UIs**.

---

### 🧠 Why Was Fiber Introduced?

Before Fiber, React's reconciliation was **synchronous** and **non-interruptible**:

* Once React started rendering a component tree, it couldn’t pause in the middle.
* This made **large component trees** slow and unresponsive (e.g., during animations or large list updates).

**Fiber solves this.**

## 🔍 Goals of React Fiber

| Goal                        | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incremental rendering**   | Split rendering into chunks; pause, resume, or abort work as needed         |
| **Prioritization**          | High-priority updates (like animations or input) can preempt low-priority   |
| **Concurrency**             | Enable future features like concurrent rendering, transitions, and suspense |
| **Better error handling**   | Catch rendering errors with error boundaries                                |
| **Backwards compatibility** | Maintain API compatibility with existing React apps                         |

## 🏗️ How Fiber Works — Conceptually

Fiber introduces a **data structure called a Fiber node** for each element/component in your React app.

Each Fiber node is like a unit of work with info like:

* The component type
* Props and state
* Child and sibling relationships
* Work priority
* DOM references

### 🔁 Two Main Phases in Fiber

1. **Render Phase** (a.k.a. **Reconciliation**)

   * React builds or updates the **Fiber tree** in memory.
   * This can be **paused**, **resumed**, and **aborted**.
   * No DOM mutations happen yet.

2. **Commit Phase**

   * React takes the changes calculated in the render phase and **commits them to the actual DOM**.
   * This part is **synchronous** and **non-interruptible**.

### 🔄 Fiber vs Old Reconciler

| Feature                 | Old Reconciler  | React Fiber              |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Interruptible rendering | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                    |
| Priority updates        | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                    |
| Concurrency             | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                    |
| Suspense/Transitions    | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Supported via Fiber    |
| Stack-based             | ✅ Yes           | ❌ Uses linked Fiber tree |

## 🧬 Fiber Node — Under the Hood

A Fiber node is a **JavaScript object** that contains:

```js
{
  type: 'div',
  key: null,
  child: <Fiber>,
  sibling: <Fiber>,
  return: <Fiber>,
  stateNode: <DOM element or class instance>,
  pendingProps: ...,
  effectTag: 'UPDATE',
  alternate: <previous fiber>
}
```

Each node forms a **tree structure** that represents the UI and allows React to traverse and update it flexibly.

---

## 🕰️ Scheduling with Fiber

React uses **cooperative scheduling**:

* Breaks work into **"units of work"**
* Yields control back to the browser between units to **keep UI responsive**
* Uses the browser’s idle time efficiently (via `requestIdleCallback` or `scheduler` package)

---

## 🔮 Features Enabled by Fiber

### 1. **Concurrent Mode**

* React can render multiple versions of the UI and **pick the best one to commit**
* Example: React can show a **loading spinner** while fetching data, without blocking user input

### 2. **Suspense**

* Lets components "wait" for something (e.g., data, code) before rendering
* Fiber tracks these suspended states and manages fallback UIs

### 3. **Transitions (`useTransition`)**

* Fiber can **prioritize user interactions** (clicks, typing) over slow UI updates (like filtering)

---

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

Think of React Fiber like a **task manager in an OS**:

* It schedules tasks (component updates)
* Prioritizes urgent ones (user input)
* Pauses low-priority tasks (big re-renders)
* Lets the system stay responsive

| Key capability  | Interruptible, prioritized rendering                         |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

You don’t usually need to **interact directly** with Fiber — it works behind the scenes. But understanding it helps you:

* Optimize performance
* Understand Suspense & concurrent features
* Debug rendering behavior
