> "What tools are used to convert modern JavaScript (ES6/ESNext) into older JavaScript so that older browsers can understand and run the code?"

---

### 🧠 **Answer: The Process Is Called Transpilation**

To make sure modern JavaScript code works in **older browsers**, we use a tool called a **transpiler**. The most common one is **Babel**.

### 🔧 What Does a Transpiler Do?

A **transpiler** (short for *source-to-source compiler*) takes your **modern code** and **rewrites it into an older version of JavaScript** that older browsers can understand.

---

### ✅ Example:

#### 👨‍💻 Modern Code (ES6+):

```js
const greet = (name = "Guest") => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
};
```

#### 💻 Old Browsers like IE11 don’t understand:

* Arrow functions (`=>`)
* Default parameters
* Template literals (`` `Hello, ${name}` ``)

#### 🔄 Transpiled Code (ES5):

```js
var greet = function(name) {
  if (name === undefined) name = "Guest";
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
};
```

Now this code can run in **older browsers** like Internet Explorer or Safari 9.

### 🛠️ Common Tools for Transpiling:

#### ✅ **Babel**

* Most widely used JavaScript transpiler
* Converts modern JS to ES5 (which most browsers support)
* Works with bundlers like **Webpack**, **Vite**, or **Rollup**

#### How Babel Works (with `@babel/preset-env`):

1. You write modern JS
2. Babel reads your `browserslist` targets
3. Babel only transpiles features **not supported** by those browsers

| Tool / Concept     | What it Does                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Babel**          | Transpiles new JS syntax to older JS             |
| **Polyfills**      | Adds missing functions/APIs (`fetch`, `Promise`) |
| **Webpack/Rollup** | Bundles and integrates Babel and polyfills       |
| **Browserslist**   | Specifies which browsers you want to support     |

### 📌 Summary:

> **Modern JavaScript is converted to older syntax using a transpiler like Babel**, based on your target browsers. This ensures your web app works across both modern and legacy browsers by transforming unsupported syntax and optionally adding polyfills for missing APIs.
