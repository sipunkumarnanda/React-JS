## 📦 What is `package.json`?

`package.json` is the **central configuration file** for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about your project (like name, version, dependencies), and one of its most useful parts is the **`scripts` section**.

---

## 🧠 What is the `scripts` Section?

The `"scripts"` section lets you define **custom commands** (called *npm scripts*) that you can run using:

```bash
npm run <script-name>
```

Or for some built-in ones like `start`, you can just run:

```bash
npm start
```

### 📄 Example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Common Scripts and What They Do

| Script Name              | Command                                               | Purpose                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `start`                  | `node server.js` (or framework command)               | Starts the app (production usually) |
| `dev`                    | `vite`, `webpack-dev-server`, etc.                    | Runs development server             |
| `build`                  | `vite build`, `webpack`, etc.                         | Creates optimized production build  |
| `test`                   | `jest`, `mocha`, etc.                                 | Runs unit or integration tests      |
| `lint`                   | `eslint src/`                                         | Checks code style and errors        |
| `format`                 | `prettier --write .`                                  | Auto-formats code                   |
| `prepare`                | Runs automatically before `npm publish` or `git push` |                                     |
| `prebuild` / `postbuild` | Hooks that run before/after build script              | For chaining tasks                  |

## ✅ How to Run These Scripts

### 🟢 Standard scripts:

```bash
npm start
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### 🟡 Custom scripts (non-standard names):

```bash
npm run myscriptname
```

---

## 📁 Real-World Example (React App)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

* `start`: Launches development server with hot reload
* `build`: Creates a static production build
* `test`: Runs test suites
* `eject`: Gives access to the underlying configuration (not reversible)

## 🔁 Lifecycle Script Hooks

You can also use **pre- and post- hooks**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "npm run lint",
    "build": "vite build",
    "postbuild": "echo 'Build complete!'"
  }
}
```

These run automatically in sequence:

```bash
npm run build
```

➡️ will run `prebuild`, then `build`, then `postbuild`

---

## 🚀 Summary Table

| Script      | Common Use                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `start`     | Run app (often in production)       |
| `dev`       | Run development server              |
| `build`     | Bundle code for production          |
| `test`      | Run tests                           |
| `lint`      | Lint code for style/errors          |
| `format`    | Format code automatically           |
| `eject`     | Expose config in CRA-based projects |
| `prebuild`  | Run before build starts             |
| `postbuild` | Run after build finishes            |

## 🧩 Bonus: Use NPM Scripts to Chain Commands

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "npm run build && node server.js"
}
```

You can chain multiple scripts together using `&&`, `&`, or use a tool like `npm-run-all`.
