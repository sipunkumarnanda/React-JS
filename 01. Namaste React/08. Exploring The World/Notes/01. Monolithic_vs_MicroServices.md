
## 🔷 Monolithic Architecture

### ✅ **Definition:**

A **single unified application** where all components (UI, business logic, data access) are combined and run as one unit.

### ✅ **Characteristics:**

* Single codebase
* All components share memory and resources
* Typically deployed as a **single jar/war or binary**

### ✅ **Advantages:**

* ✅ **Easy to develop** in early stages
* ✅ **Simple to test** (only one deployable unit)
* ✅ **Faster performance** (local calls, no network overhead)
* ✅ **Easier debugging** (centralized logs and stack traces)

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**

* ❌ **Hard to scale** specific parts independently
* ❌ **Slower deployments** (entire app must be rebuilt/redeployed)
* ❌ **Tightly coupled code** — small changes can affect the whole app
* ❌ **Not flexible** for adopting new technologies in parts of the system

## 🔷 Microservices Architecture

### ✅ **Definition:**

An application is divided into **multiple smaller, independent services**, each responsible for a specific functionality.

### ✅ **Characteristics:**

* Each service has its own codebase
* Services communicate via **APIs (HTTP/REST, gRPC, messaging)**
* Deployed **independently**

### ✅ **Advantages:**

* ✅ **Scalability** — scale only the needed services
* ✅ **Faster deployment** — update only the modified services
* ✅ **Technology flexibility** — different services can use different stacks
* ✅ **Resilience** — failure in one service doesn’t crash the whole app
* ✅ **Better team ownership** — teams can own and deploy their own services

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**

* ❌ **Complexity** — managing many services, networks, databases
* ❌ **Testing is harder** — integration testing across services
* ❌ **Latency** — inter-service communication adds network delay
* ❌ **DevOps overhead** — needs CI/CD, monitoring, service discovery, etc.
