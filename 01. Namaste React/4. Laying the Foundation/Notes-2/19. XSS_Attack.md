**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** is a type of **security vulnerability** where an attacker injects **malicious scripts** (usually JavaScript) into content that is later rendered by another user's browser.

These scripts can:

* Steal cookies or tokens
* Redirect users
* Log keystrokes
* Deface content
* Perform actions as the user (e.g., send API requests with the user's auth)

---

## 🎯 Types of XSS Attacks

There are **3 main types**:

---

### 1. 🧪 Stored XSS (Persistent)

**Malicious script is stored in a database** and served to users later.

**Example:**

* Attacker submits a comment with:

  ```html
  <script>alert("Hacked")</script>
  ```
* Comment is saved to DB and shown to every user who visits the page.

---

### 2. 🧪 Reflected XSS (Non-persistent)

Malicious script is reflected via the URL or query string and executed when the page loads.

**Example:**

```js
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

If the site renders `q` directly into the page without sanitizing, the script runs.

---

### 3. 🧪 DOM-based XSS

Happens **entirely in the browser** — the malicious script comes from the page itself via DOM manipulation (e.g., from `location.hash`, `document.referrer`, or `innerHTML`).

---

## 🧨 Real-World Example

Suppose a site shows user bios like this:

```html
<div id="bio"></div>
<script>
  document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = getUserBio();
</script>
```

If `getUserBio()` returns:

```html
<img src=x onerror="alert('Hacked!')" />
```

✅ Browser renders the image
❌ Then runs `onerror`, triggering an alert or worse (e.g., steal session)

---

## ⚠️ Why XSS is Dangerous

An attacker could:

* **Steal session cookies**:

  ```js
  document.cookie
  ```
* **Modify the page** to trick the user (e.g., fake login form)
* **Send AJAX requests** as the user:

  ```js
  fetch('/api/delete-account')
  ```
* **Keylog your input**

## 🛡️ How to Prevent XSS

### 🔒 On the Frontend (React, etc.)

✅ React automatically escapes content in JSX:

```jsx
<p>{user.bio}</p> // Safe
```

🚨 **Danger** if you use:

```jsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: user.bio }} />
```

💡 Use libraries like **DOMPurify** to sanitize:

```js
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(user.bio) }} />
```

---

### 🔒 On the Backend (Node.js, Express, etc.)

* **Escape output**: Always sanitize content before sending it to the frontend.
* Use libraries like:

  * `xss`
  * `sanitize-html`
  * `validator`
* Set **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers to restrict inline scripts:

  ```http
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
  ```

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Type          | Trigger                         | Stored? | Prevent By                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Stored XSS    | Displaying unescaped user input | Yes     | Sanitize before saving and rendering   |
| Reflected XSS | Injected via URL/query          | No      | Sanitize input and escape output       |
| DOM-based XSS | Injected via JS in the frontend | No      | Avoid `innerHTML`, sanitize DOM inputs |

## 🔚 Conclusion

* XSS is one of the **most common vulnerabilities** in web apps.
* React protects you **by default**, but you still need to be cautious.
* **Never insert raw HTML** from users without sanitizing it.
* **Use libraries like DOMPurify**, CSP headers, and validate input everywhere.
