
# ```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

### ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s the React Component Here?

In this specific line:

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

ðŸ‘‰ `"h1"` is **not a React component**.
ðŸ‘‰ `"h1"` is a **native HTML element tag**.

So in this case, React is creating a **React element** that wraps a **built-in DOM element** (`<h1>`), **not a custom component**.

### ðŸ’¡ Difference Between DOM Elements and Components

| JSX/React Element | Type in `React.createElement`  | What It Represents     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `<h1>Hello</h1>`  | `"h1"` (string)                | Built-in HTML tag      |
| `<MyComponent />` | `MyComponent` (function/class) | Custom React component |

### âœ… Example of Custom Component:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}

// JSX
<Greeting />

// Transpiled version:
React.createElement(Greeting, null)
```

Here, `Greeting` is the **React component**.

### ðŸ§  Summary:

* In `React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello")`, **no custom React component** is used.
* `"h1"` is a **string representing an HTML tag**, so it's a **native DOM element**, not a React component.
* A **React component** would appear as a function/class reference, not a string.
