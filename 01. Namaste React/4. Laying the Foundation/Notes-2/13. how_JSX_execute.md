
## ❓ **How does JSX execute?**

> **JSX does not run directly in the browser.**
> It’s **compiled (transpiled)** into regular JavaScript using a tool like **Babel** before it can be executed.

Let’s explore what actually happens when you write JSX.

---

## 🧾 Step-by-Step Execution of JSX

---

### ✅ 1. **You Write JSX in Code**

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This looks like HTML, but it’s actually **not HTML** — it’s a **syntax extension to JavaScript**.

---

### 🔧 2. **JSX Gets Compiled by Babel**

React apps (e.g. with Vite, Webpack, or Create React App) include Babel, which **translates JSX into JavaScript**.

That JSX becomes:

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  { className: 'greeting' },
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

This is pure JavaScript now — the browser understands it.

> JSX → Babel → `React.createElement()` → JavaScript object

---

### 🧱 3. **`React.createElement()` Returns a ReactElement**

The function call returns a **ReactElement**, which is **not the real DOM element**, but a **plain JavaScript object**:

```js
{
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
}
```

This object is stored in React's **virtual DOM**.

---

### 🖼️ 4. **React Virtual DOM Tree is Built**

If your component has nested elements:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>Welcome</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each element gets turned into a **ReactElement**, and React builds a tree-like structure in memory — called the **virtual DOM**.

---

### ⚙️ 5. **React Renders to the Real DOM**

After React has the virtual DOM, it compares it to the **previous virtual DOM** (if this is an update), and **calculates the minimum changes** needed to update the real DOM (this is reconciliation + diffing).

Then it uses the browser's DOM API (`document.createElement`, etc.) to render it to the screen.

JSX Code
   ↓
Babel (compiles to)
   ↓
React.createElement()
   ↓
Creates ReactElement (virtual DOM node)
   ↓
React builds virtual DOM tree
   ↓
React diffs and updates real DOM efficiently
```

## 🎯 Example in Full

```jsx
// JSX
const greeting = <h1 className="title">Hello</h1>;

// Transpiles to:
const greeting = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  { className: 'title' },
  'Hello'
);

// React renders it to real DOM
```

This object is passed to `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`:

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(greeting);
```

And React will render:

```html
<h1 class="title">Hello</h1>
```

## ✅ Key Concepts Behind JSX Execution

| Concept            | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSX**            | Syntax sugar for `React.createElement()`             |
| **Babel**          | Compiles JSX to JavaScript                           |
| **ReactElement**   | JavaScript object representing the UI                |
| **Virtual DOM**    | In-memory tree React uses to track UI                |
| **Reconciliation** | React’s process of updating the real DOM efficiently |

## 🧠 Final Thought

> JSX lets you write **UI like HTML**, but under the hood, it's **just JavaScript**.
> It becomes **ReactElements**, which React uses to build and update the UI via the virtual DOM.
