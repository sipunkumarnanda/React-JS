
# **Browserslist** and `"last 2 versions of Chrome"`.

---

### ❓ ** Question :**

> "When I specify `last 2 versions of Chrome` in my Browserslist configuration, does that mean my code will only work in the last 2 versions of Chrome, or will it also work in other versions (like older or non-Chrome browsers)? What does this setting actually do in terms of transpilation and compatibility?"

### 🧠 Understanding the `browserslist` Setting

**Browserslist** is a tool that defines which browsers your front-end code should support. Tools like **Babel**, **Autoprefixer**, and **webpack** use this config to decide **what features to transpile or polyfill**.

### ✅ `"last 2 Chrome versions"` — What it Means

If you set in your `.browserslistrc` or `package.json`:

```json
"browserslist": [
  "last 2 Chrome versions"
]
```

This means:

* You're telling Babel or Autoprefixer: **"Only worry about supporting the latest 2 released versions of Chrome."**
* For example, if the latest versions are **Chrome 126 and Chrome 125**, then **only** these two versions are targeted.
* Features not supported in older versions (like Chrome 90 or Internet Explorer) **will not be transpiled or polyfilled**.

### 🔍 Implications

#### ✅ Will it work in the last 2 versions of Chrome?

Yes. That's exactly what it's targeting. Babel will **only transpile** features that are unsupported in **Chrome 125 and 126**, ensuring the generated code runs well in those.

#### ❌ Will it work in **older versions** of Chrome?

**Not guaranteed.** If you're using modern JavaScript (e.g. `optional chaining`, `nullish coalescing`, or ES2020 features), Babel might **not** transpile them to work on Chrome 70, 80, or IE11 — because those versions are not part of your target.

#### ❌ Will it work in Firefox, Safari, or Edge?

**Also not guaranteed.** If you only list `"last 2 Chrome versions"`, you're **excluding** all other browsers from the target list. So if Firefox or Safari lacks support for a feature you're using, your code may break there.

### ✅ Best Practice for Cross-Browser Support

If you want broader support, use:

```json
"browserslist": [
  "last 2 versions",
  "> 1%",
  "not dead"
]
```

This means:

* Support the **last 2 versions** of **all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* Include any browser with **>1% global usage**.
* Exclude outdated/unsupported ones ("dead" = no longer maintained).

### 🧪 Summary

| Setting                  | Targets                          | Guarantees compatibility with |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `last 2 Chrome versions` | Chrome's latest 2 only           | Chrome 125, 126               |
| `last 2 versions`        | All major browsers (2 each)      | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. |
| `> 1%`                   | Browsers with >1% market share   | Varies globally               |
| `not dead`               | Excludes IE and old unmaintained | Current browsers only         |
