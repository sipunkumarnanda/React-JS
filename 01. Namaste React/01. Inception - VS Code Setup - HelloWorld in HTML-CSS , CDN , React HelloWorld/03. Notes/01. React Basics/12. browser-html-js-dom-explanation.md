### 1. **Loading and Parsing HTML**

* When you open an HTML page in your browser, the browser **fetches the HTML file** and starts reading it **line by line** from top to bottom.
* The browser uses a **parser** to read the HTML code and creates a structured representation called the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.
* The DOM is like a **tree structure** where each HTML element (tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, etc.) is a **node** in that tree.
* This DOM tree is what the browser uses to **display the page visually** on the screen.

### 2. **What is the DOM?**

* The DOM is a **programmatic representation of your webpage**.
* It exposes the elements on your page as objects that JavaScript can manipulate.
* For example, a `<div>` tag becomes a `div` object in the DOM, and JavaScript can access it, change its style, add content, or remove it.

### 3. **How Does JavaScript Interact with the DOM?**

* In your JavaScript code, you can use **global objects** provided by the browser, such as `document`.
* `document` represents the entire HTML document loaded in the browser.
* JavaScript uses this `document` object to **access, create, modify, or delete elements**.

### 4. **What is `document.createElement()`?**

* `document.createElement()` is a **method** on the `document` object.
* It creates a **new HTML element** (like a new `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<button>`) **but it is not yet added to the page**.
* After creating this element, you can modify it â€” add text, classes, styles, or other attributes.
* To display it on the webpage, you then **append it to an existing node** using methods like `appendChild()` or `insertBefore()`.

**Example:**

```js
// Create a new paragraph element
const p = document.createElement('p');

// Set text content of the paragraph
p.textContent = "Hello, I am new here!";

// Append the paragraph to the body of the document
document.body.appendChild(p);
```

### 5. **How Does the Browser Know About `document` and Methods Like `createElement`?**

* Browsers provide a **JavaScript environment** that includes predefined objects and methods. This environment is called the **Browser API**.
* The `document` object and all DOM methods are part of this Browser API.
* When your JavaScript runs, it runs in this environment, so it has access to `document`, `window`, `console`, and many other objects.
* These are **not part of JavaScript language itself**, but part of the environment where JavaScript runs (the browser).

### 6. **Step-by-Step: What Happens When You Run JS that Manipulates DOM?**

* JavaScript engine reads your JS code.
* When it encounters `document.createElement('div')`:

  * It calls the browser's DOM API to create a new `<div>` element object.
* When you call `document.body.appendChild(div)`:

  * The browser adds that element to the DOM tree inside `<body>`.
  * The browser then re-renders the page to reflect the change.
