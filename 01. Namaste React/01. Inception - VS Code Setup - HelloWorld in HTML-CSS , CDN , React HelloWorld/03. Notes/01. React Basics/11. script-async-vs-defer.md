When you include JavaScript files in your HTML using `<script>`, how and when those scripts load and execute affects your webpage’s performance and user experience.

By default, `<script src="..."></script>` **blocks** HTML parsing — the browser stops building the page until the script is fetched and executed. This can make pages slow.

To improve this, HTML5 introduced two attributes to control script loading behavior:

* `async`
* `defer`

---

## 1. Default Behavior (No attribute)

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

* The browser **pauses HTML parsing** to download and execute the script immediately.
* This can cause render-blocking — the page waits for the script before continuing to load.
* Script execution order is **guaranteed** (scripts run in the order they appear).

---

## 2. `async` Attribute

```html
<script async src="script.js"></script>
```

* The script is fetched **asynchronously**, meaning it downloads **in parallel** while HTML parsing continues.
* **BUT** once downloaded, the script executes **immediately**, **pausing HTML parsing** at that moment.
* Scripts with `async` execute as soon as they are ready — order of execution **is NOT guaranteed** if you have multiple async scripts.

### When to use `async`?

* For scripts that are **independent** and do not rely on or affect other scripts or DOM content.
* Examples: Analytics, ads, tracking scripts.

### Summary:

| Behavior           | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Download           | In parallel with HTML parsing             |
| Execution          | As soon as download completes             |
| Order of execution | Not guaranteed for multiple async scripts |
| HTML parsing       | Paused during script execution            |

---

## 3. `defer` Attribute

```html
<script defer src="script.js"></script>
```

* The script is fetched **in parallel** with HTML parsing, like `async`.
* But script execution is **deferred** until **after the entire HTML document is parsed**.
* Scripts with `defer` **execute in the order they appear** in the HTML.
* Guarantees DOM is fully built before script runs.

### When to use `defer`?

* For scripts that **need the DOM to be fully built** before running.
* Useful when your script depends on the HTML elements being present.

### Summary:

| Behavior           | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Download           | In parallel with HTML parsing      |
| Execution          | After HTML parsing is finished     |
| Order of execution | Guaranteed, in order of appearance |
| HTML parsing       | Not blocked by script execution    |

## 4. Summary Table: Default vs Async vs Defer

| Attribute | Download | Execution                   | Execution Order | HTML Parsing Blocked? | Best Use Case                         |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| None      | Blocking | Immediately, blocking       | Yes             | Yes                   | Critical scripts that must run early  |
| `async`   | Parallel | As soon as ready, blocking  | No              | Only during execution | Independent scripts (analytics, ads)  |
| `defer`   | Parallel | After parsing, non-blocking | Yes             | No                    | Scripts depending on DOM (UI scripts) |

---

## 5. Example Usage

```html
<!-- Script blocks parsing -->
<script src="blocking.js"></script>

<!-- Script downloads asynchronously, executes ASAP -->
<script async src="async.js"></script>

<!-- Script downloads asynchronously, executes after parsing -->
<script defer src="defer.js"></script>
```

---

## 6. Important Notes

* `async` and `defer` **only work with external scripts** (with `src` attribute). Inline scripts ignore them.
* Browsers **ignore `async` and `defer` on inline scripts**.
* `defer` scripts will always execute **before** `DOMContentLoaded` event fires, so you can safely manipulate DOM in them.

---

## 7. Why Use These Attributes?

* To **improve page load speed** and **user experience**.
* Avoid render-blocking scripts.
* Manage script execution order and timing carefully.
* Optimize loading of third-party or non-critical scripts.

---

# Summary:

* Use **`async`** for scripts that don’t depend on other scripts or DOM.
* Use **`defer`** for scripts that require the DOM to be ready and to maintain execution order.
* Avoid blocking the main thread to keep pages fast and responsive.
