
## üß† Overview: React vs ReactDOM

| Concept    | React                                    | ReactDOM                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What it is | A **JavaScript library** for building UI | A **library** that allows React to interact with the **DOM** |
| Role       | Defines and creates components           | Renders those components into the DOM                        |
| Scope      | **Core library** for building interfaces | **Platform-specific** DOM rendering                          |
| Used for   | Declaring UI logic with components       | Inserting components into a webpage                          |

## üîπ What is **React**?

React is the **core library**. It helps you:

* Create components (`function` or `class`)
* Handle **state** and **props**
* Manage **UI logic**
* Use **Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

üì¶ It comes from the **`react`** package:

```js
import React from 'react';
```

This allows you to write JSX like:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```

But just creating the component doesn‚Äôt display it anywhere ‚Äî it lives in memory, not on the actual web page.

## üîπ What is **ReactDOM**?

ReactDOM is responsible for:

* Taking your **React components**
* And rendering them into the **real DOM**

üì¶ It comes from the **`react-dom`** package:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
```

You use it to connect React with your HTML file:

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

So:

* `React` is for building your components (structure, state, logic)
* `ReactDOM` is for placing them on the screen (browser DOM)

---

## üß¨ Real-World Analogy

Think of React as **an architect**:

* Designs your house on paper (components, structure)

And ReactDOM as **a construction team**:

* Takes the blueprints and **builds it on actual land** (the DOM)

You need both: design + execution.

## üìÅ Example: Where They Work Together

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

### What‚Äôs Happening?

* ‚úÖ `React` is used to define `App` component (in App.jsx)
* ‚úÖ `ReactDOM` puts `<App />` into the HTML page (`<div id="root">`)

## üß™ Advanced Note: React Native

ReactDOM is **specific to the web**.

For other platforms:

| Platform             | Renderer           |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Web (Browser)        | `react-dom`        |
| Mobile (iOS/Android) | `react-native`     |
| Server-side          | `react-dom/server` |

So, React stays the same across platforms ‚Äî but rendering happens differently using **platform-specific libraries**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature      | React                    | ReactDOM                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Create UI and components | Render components into the DOM   |
| From Package | `react`                  | `react-dom`                      |
| Usage        | JSX, state, props, hooks | `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()` |
| Scope        | Platform-agnostic        | Web-browser specific             |
