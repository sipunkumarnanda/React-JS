These scripts are loading React and ReactDOM **in development mode** using the **UMD (Universal Module Definition)** build from the [UNPKG CDN](https://unpkg.com).

Now, let’s break them down 👇

---

## 🔹 `<script src="react.development.js">` — Loads React

This script loads the **React library** itself.

**React**:

* Is the **core library** for creating and managing **components**
* Handles things like:

  * JSX interpretation
  * State management
  * Lifecycle (like `useEffect`)
  * Hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, etc.)

> 💡 Think of **React** as the "brains" — it knows how your app should behave and look.

However, it **does NOT render** anything to the screen. That’s where ReactDOM comes in.

## 🔹 `<script src="react-dom.development.js">` — Loads ReactDOM

This script loads the **ReactDOM library**, which is **responsible for rendering** React components to the actual **webpage DOM**.

**ReactDOM**:

* Connects React with the **real browser DOM**
* Has methods like:

  * `ReactDOM.createRoot()` for modern rendering
  * `ReactDOM.render()` (older method)
* Is specific to web browsers

> 💡 Think of **ReactDOM** as the "hands" — it physically places your React app into the page.

## ⚙️ `<script src="script.js">` — Loads Your React App Code

This script contains **your own code** — where you'll:

* Define components using `React.createElement()` or JSX (transpiled by Babel)
* Use `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)` to mount your components

## 🧠 Example Summary:

| Library      | Role                            | Example Functionality                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **React**    | Build and manage components     | `React.createElement()`, `useState()` |
| **ReactDOM** | Render components to the screen | `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`      |

## 💡 Analogy

* **React** is like writing your UI logic on paper.
* **ReactDOM** takes that paper and **pins it on the wall** (the DOM).

You can build everything with React, but **nothing shows up in the browser** until ReactDOM is used.
