| Concept | Framework                        | Library                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Analogy | Buying a Fully-Furnished Flat 🏢 | Building Your Own House 🏗️ |

### 🧱 1. **Framework = Buying a Ready-to-Live Flat (Apartment)**

* The structure is already built.
* The rooms are fixed (kitchen, hall, bedrooms).
* You follow the building's rules (no changing external walls, no open fire).
* You can customize a few things like wall paint or furniture – but the major control is with the builder.

**👨‍💼 Real Tech Example: Angular (Framework)**

* Angular gives you a full structure: routing, state, HTTP, build tools.
* You **must follow Angular's architecture**.
* Angular decides **how and when** your code runs.

### 🔨 2. **Library = Building Your Own House on a Plot**

* You get an open land (plot).
* You hire your own team: architect, builder, interior designer.
* You decide: how many rooms, where the kitchen goes, how it looks.
* You **have full control** over design and structure.

**👨‍💻 Real Tech Example: React (Library)**

* React gives you tools for UI (like an architect giving a design).
* You decide:

  * How routing works (`react-router`)
  * How state works (`redux`, `context`)
  * Where and how things are placed
* **You are in full control.**

### 💬 Summary in Simple Terms:

| Aspect             | Framework (Flat)         | Library (Own House)               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Structure Provided | Yes                      | No                                |
| Flexibility        | Low                      | High                              |
| Control            | Framework is in control  | You are in control                |
| Customization      | Limited to certain areas | Unlimited – you design everything |
| Example            | Angular, Next.js         | React, Lodash                     |

### 📌 Final Thought:

> 💡 *"Frameworks give you rules and structure. Libraries give you freedom and tools."*
> Just like buying a flat gives you convenience with limits, and building a house gives you flexibility with responsibility.
