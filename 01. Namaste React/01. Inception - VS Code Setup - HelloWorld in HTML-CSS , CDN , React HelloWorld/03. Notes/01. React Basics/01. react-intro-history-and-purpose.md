
### 📘 Is React a Library or Framework?

**React is a *JavaScript library*** — not a full-fledged framework.

#### ✅ Why it's a Library:

* React focuses **only on the "View"** part of the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.
* It **doesn’t enforce rules** about routing, state management, or how to structure your project.
* Developers are free to choose tools (e.g., Redux, React Router) to complement React for a more "framework-like" experience.

So in summary:

> React is a **flexible, declarative UI library**, not a complete framework like Angular.

### 🎯 Why React Was Built

Before React, Facebook had complex UI challenges, especially for **news feeds and dynamic user interfaces**.

#### Problems They Faced:

1. **Performance Issues** — DOM manipulations were slow and inefficient.
2. **Complex State Management** — Managing UI state across large applications became hard.
3. **Code Reusability** — UIs were difficult to break down into reusable components.

#### The Solution: React

React introduced a few revolutionary ideas:

| Concept                          | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual DOM**                  | Efficiently updates and renders only the parts of the UI that change.     |
| **Component-Based Architecture** | Breaks UIs into small, reusable, independent components.                  |
| **One-Way Data Binding**         | Data flows in a single direction for better predictability and debugging. |
