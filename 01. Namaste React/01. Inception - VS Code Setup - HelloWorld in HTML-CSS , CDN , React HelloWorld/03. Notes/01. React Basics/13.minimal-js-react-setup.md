**JavaScript:**

* The absolute shortest JavaScript program is an empty `.js` file with no code.
* Even a blank file is valid JavaScript and runs without errors.

**React:**

* React requires including two core libraries via CDN to run in a browser without build tools:

```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

* These scripts load React and ReactDOM, enabling you to write React components and render them to the DOM.
* Without these libraries, React code cannot execute.

---

**Summary:**

* JS: empty file is minimal runnable program.
* React: minimal setup includes linking React and ReactDOM scripts via CDN in HTML.

# Minimal JavaScript and React Programs with Setup

### 1. Shortest JavaScript Program

A valid JavaScript program can be as simple as an empty file. The smallest meaningful program is just a single statement:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

This prints "Hello" to the console. An empty `.js` file also runs without error but does nothing.

### 2. Shortest React Program (Functional Component)

In React, the minimal program is a functional component returning JSX:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => <div>Hello</div>;

export default App;
```

This defines a simple React component that renders a `<div>` with the text "Hello".

### 3. Minimal React Setup Using CDN (No Build Tools)

You can run React in a browser without any build setup by including React and ReactDOM via CDN links:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Minimal React</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <!-- React and ReactDOM CDN scripts -->
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

  <!-- React rendering script -->
  <script>
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
    root.render(React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello from React!'));
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

* Here, React and ReactDOM are loaded from CDN.
* The React element is created with `React.createElement`.
* ReactDOM renders the element inside the `#root` div.
