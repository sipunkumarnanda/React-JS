### 🔹 What is a CDN?

A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** is a group of globally distributed servers that deliver static content (like CSS, JS, images, etc.) **from the server nearest to the user**.

Instead of downloading everything from a central server (e.g., in the USA), a CDN helps deliver content from a closer location (like a server in India, if you are located there), making the website load **faster** and more **reliable**.

### 🔹 Why We Use CDN?

✅ **Faster website performance**
✅ **Reduced load on main server**
✅ **Improved availability and uptime**
✅ **Efficient for large traffic**
✅ **Better global accessibility**
✅ **Easy integration** without downloading and hosting files yourself

## 🔗 CDN Links to Use React and Tailwind in HTML

You can use the following **CDN links** in a plain HTML file to use **React** and **Tailwind CSS** without installing them via npm.

### ✅ Basic HTML with React + ReactDOM + Babel CDN

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>React + Tailwind CDN</title>

  <!-- Tailwind CSS CDN -->
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

  <!-- React and ReactDOM CDN -->
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

  <!-- Babel CDN to compile JSX in browser (for development only) -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100 p-6">

  <div id="root"></div>

  <script type="text/babel">
    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="text-center p-6 bg-white shadow-md rounded-md">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">Hello from React + Tailwind via CDN!</h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">This is rendered using JSX and styled with Tailwind CSS.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<App />);
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

### ⚠️ Notes:

* **`tailwindcss.com`** is used to load Tailwind CSS styles.
* **`unpkg.com`** serves the latest React and ReactDOM builds.
* **Babel** is needed here to convert JSX into regular JavaScript in the browser – only use this in development, not in production.
