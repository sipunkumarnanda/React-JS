
# Understanding `React.createElement` and Its Output Object

### Code:

```js
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Namaste Everyone!");
console.log(heading);
```

---

### What happens here?

1. **`React.createElement`** is a core React API function used to create a React element.

   * It returns a **JavaScript object** representing a virtual DOM element.
   * React uses this object internally to know what to render on the actual DOM.

2. **Parameters explained:**

   ```js
   React.createElement(type, props, children);
   ```

   * **type**: The type of element you want to create, here `"h1"` means an `<h1>` HTML element.
   * **props**: An object containing properties/attributes of the element (like `id`, `className`, `style`, etc.) — in this case, it’s an empty object `{}`, so no attributes.
   * **children**: The content inside the element — here it is the string `"Namaste Everyone!"`.

### What does the output object mean?

When you log `heading`, you get something like:

```js
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
  type: 'h1',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    children: "Namaste Everyone!"
  },
  _owner: null,
  _store: {}
}
```

* **`$$typeof: Symbol(react.element)`**: This is an internal identifier React uses to recognize this object as a React element.
* **`type: 'h1'`**: The type of the element to render — in this case an `<h1>` tag.
* **`key: null`**: Used for identifying elements in lists; null means no key provided here.
* **`ref: null`**: Used to access underlying DOM elements or React components; none here.
* **`props`**: An object holding all the properties and children for this element.

  * Here, `props` only contains one property, `children`, with the string `"Namaste Everyone!"` — this is the content inside `<h1>`.
* **`_owner` and `_store`**: Internal React properties used for debugging and optimizations.

### What goes inside the `{}` (props)?

This is where you specify any attributes or properties you want the element to have. For example:

```js
React.createElement("h1", { id: "main-heading", className: "title" }, "Namaste Everyone!");
```

Here, the props object is:

```js
{
  id: "main-heading",
  className: "title"
}
```

* React uses this to set the HTML attributes: `<h1 id="main-heading" class="title">Namaste Everyone!</h1>`

---

### Summary for Beginners:

* `React.createElement` creates a virtual React element as a JS object.
* The empty `{}` means no props/attributes.
* The string after that is the content inside the element.
* This object is what React uses to know how to render or update the UI.
