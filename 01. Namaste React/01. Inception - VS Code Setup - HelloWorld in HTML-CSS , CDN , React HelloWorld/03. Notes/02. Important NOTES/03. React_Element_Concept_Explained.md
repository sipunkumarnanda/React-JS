### Definition:

A **React Element** is the smallest building block of React apps. It’s a plain JavaScript object that describes **what you want to see on the screen** — like an instruction to React about what to render.

---

### Key Points:

* React Element is **not** the actual DOM element you see in the browser.
* It is a lightweight description of a DOM node or a React component.
* React uses these elements to build the **Virtual DOM** — a representation of the UI in memory.
* React compares these React Elements with previous versions to update only what’s necessary in the real DOM (this process is called **reconciliation**).

### How React Elements are Created?

You create React elements in two main ways:

1. **Using JSX:**

   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
   ```

   This JSX code is syntactic sugar. Under the hood, it compiles to:

2. **Using `React.createElement`:**

   ```js
   const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");
   ```

   This returns a React Element object.

### Structure of a React Element Object

A React Element object looks like this:

```js
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),  // internal React marker
  type: "h1",                       // type of element (HTML tag or React component)
  key: null,                       // unique key for lists, helps React track elements
  ref: null,                       // reference to the DOM node or component instance
  props: {                        // props/attributes and children
    children: "Hello, React!"
  },
  _owner: null,                   // internal React use for tracking
  _store: {}                      // internal React use for tracking
}
```

### Why React Elements?

React Elements are a **declarative way to describe your UI**. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, you tell React:

* "I want an `<h1>` with this text."
* React then builds a React Element object.
* React efficiently updates the real DOM based on changes in these objects.

---

### Important:

* **React Element ≠ React Component.**

  * React Element is an object describing a UI node.
  * React Component is a function or class that returns React Elements.

---

### Summary for Beginners:

* React Element = A JavaScript object describing a UI node (like a virtual DOM element).
* Created via JSX or `React.createElement()`.
* Used by React to build and update the UI efficiently.
