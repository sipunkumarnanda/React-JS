
# 🎛️ Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React

React provides two main ways to manage form elements: **Controlled Components** and **Uncontrolled Components**. Understanding the difference between them is essential for managing form state and user interactions efficiently.

## 🔹 1. Controlled Component

### ✅ Definition

A **Controlled Component** is a component where **form data is handled by the React component's state**. React becomes the "single source of truth" for the input values.

### 📦 Characteristics

* The input's value is bound to state (`value={value}`).
* On every change, React updates its internal state via `onChange`.
* Fully controlled by the component.

### 🧠 Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => setName(e.target.value);

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted Name: ${name}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 📌 Notes

* Form data is immediately available in state.
* Enables validation, conditional rendering, and dynamic forms.
* Better for complex forms or where data manipulation is needed.

## 🔹 2. Uncontrolled Component

### ✅ Definition

An **Uncontrolled Component** is where the **DOM handles the form element state**. You access the input values using **Refs** instead of managing them in state.

### 📦 Characteristics

* The input’s value is managed by the DOM.
* React only accesses the value when needed (e.g., on submit).
* Use `React.createRef()` or `useRef()` to access the input.

### 🧠 Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const nameRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted Name: ${nameRef.current.value}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={nameRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 📌 Notes

* Less code for simple forms.
* React doesn't re-render on every keystroke.
* Cannot validate or manipulate the value as it changes.

## 🆚 3. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components – Comparison

| Feature              | Controlled Component             | Uncontrolled Component                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Data Source          | React state                      | DOM (via refs)                                 |
| Value Binding        | `value={...}`                    | Default value or uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) |
| On Change Handling   | `onChange` updates state         | Not required; data read via ref                |
| Real-time Validation | Easy and built-in                | Harder to implement                            |
| Use Case             | Complex forms, dynamic inputs    | Simple forms, quick prototyping                |
| Performance          | Slightly lower due to re-renders | Faster for large inputs (no state updates)     |
| React Form Libraries | Works well (e.g. with Formik)    | Limited support                                |

## 🔍 4. When to Use Which?

| Scenario                                     | Recommended Component     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dynamic field validation                     | ✅ Controlled              |
| Forms with conditional rendering             | ✅ Controlled              |
| Handling file inputs                         | ✅ Uncontrolled (required) |
| Integrating with non-React code or libraries | ✅ Uncontrolled            |
| Very simple form (no validation needed)      | ✅ Uncontrolled            |
| Form libraries like Formik / React Hook Form | ✅ Controlled              |

## 💡 5. Best Practices

### ✅ Controlled Components

* Use for consistency and real-time control.
* Avoid unnecessary re-renders by isolating state.
* Keep forms debounced if inputs are large or slow.

### ✅ Uncontrolled Components

* Good for integrating with existing or legacy DOM code.
* Use `defaultValue` instead of `value` to avoid warnings.
* Be cautious with refs — they don’t trigger re-renders.

## 🧾 6. Summary

| Controlled Component         | Uncontrolled Component            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| React is source of truth     | DOM is source of truth            |
| Uses state                   | Uses refs                         |
| More powerful, more verbose  | Simpler, but less flexible        |
| Preferred in most React apps | Use for edge cases or performance |
