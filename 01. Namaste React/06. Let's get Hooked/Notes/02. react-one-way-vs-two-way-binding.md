---

## üß† First: What is Data Binding?

**Data binding** is how data connects between your **JavaScript logic (state)** and your **UI (DOM)**.

---

## üîÅ React Uses One-Way Data Binding (Only)

### üîπ What is One-Way Binding in React?

In React, **data flows in one direction**:

> **State ‚û°Ô∏è UI**

This means:

* You store data in a component‚Äôs **state** (using `useState`).
* You pass that state to the **UI** (like input, div, etc.).
* If the UI changes (like typing), you manually update the state using an `onChange` handler.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: One-Way Binding in React

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("John");

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={name} 
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <p>Hello, {name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### üîç Explanation:

* `value={name}`: The input **gets its value from state**.
* `onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}`: Updates the state **when you type**.
* `name` ‚Üí input ‚Üí typing ‚Üí `setName()` ‚Üí rerenders.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs **controlled input** with **one-way binding**.

## üîÅ Does React Have Two-Way Data Binding?

> ‚ùå **No, React doesn‚Äôt support two-way binding out of the box.**

You **manually** wire both directions:

1. Pass value from state to input
2. Write `onChange` to update state when input changes

## üÜö Summary: One-Way vs Two-Way in React Context

| Concept            | One-Way Binding (‚úÖ What React uses)        | Two-Way Binding (‚ùå Not native in React)         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Data Flow          | State ‚Üí UI only (with controlled updates)  | UI ‚Üî State (automatic sync, like Angular)       |
| Input Control      | You manually manage updates via `onChange` | Framework handles both directions automatically |
| Easy to Debug?     | ‚úÖ Yes                                      | ‚ùå Can get confusing                             |
| In React?          | ‚úÖ Yes (default)                            | ‚ùå No (not built-in)                             |
| Example Frameworks | React                                      | Angular, Vue (`v-model`)                        |

## üí¨ Why React Chooses One-Way Binding

React encourages **unidirectional data flow** for:

* Predictability
* Easier debugging
* Better component reusability

> One-way binding gives **you full control** over how data flows and updates.
