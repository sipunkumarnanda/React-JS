---

## 1. ✅ Basic Behavior in HTML

### Example:

```html
<input type="text" class="search-input" placeholder="search" defaultValue="kfc" />
```

### What Happens:

* This is plain HTML.
* The browser renders the input field with the default value `"kfc"`.
* Since there's **no JavaScript controlling the value**, the user can freely type or change the value inside the box.
* The value is not controlled by anything—just set initially.

## 2. ❗Why JSX Input Fields Behave Differently

### JSX Example:

```jsx
<input type="text" className="search-input" placeholder="search" defaultValue="kfc" />
```

This **looks** like HTML, but it runs in **React**, and React works differently.

### ✅ What `defaultValue` Does in React:

* `defaultValue` sets the initial value **only on first render**.
* React treats this as an **uncontrolled component** — meaning React doesn't care about the value after the first render.
* You can type freely in the box—React won’t interfere with your changes.

### ❌ But If You Accidentally Do This:

```jsx
<input type="text" value="kfc" />
```

* Now React treats it as a **controlled component**.
* You're telling React: *“Hey, I want the value of this input to **always** be 'kfc'. Don't let the user change it.”*
* **Without an `onChange`**, React prevents editing, making the input **read-only**.

## 3. 🎯 Key Difference: Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

| Type                    | HTML Behavior                      | React JSX Behavior                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultValue`          | Sets the initial value.            | Sets value only on first render (uncontrolled). |
| `value` (no `onChange`) | Editable. Browser handles updates. | Read-only. React blocks user typing.            |
| `value` + `onChange`    | Not applicable in plain HTML       | Controlled input. React manages the value.      |

---

## 4. 💡 How React Treats Inputs Behind the Scenes

React monitors inputs **differently** based on how you bind them:

* `value` → React is in **full control**, expects `onChange` to update the value.
* `defaultValue` → React sets an initial value, then lets the DOM take over.
* No `value` or `defaultValue` → Fully unmanaged (not recommended for dynamic UIs).

## 5. ✅ Best Practice in React

If you want a text input the user can type into and you want to manage or retrieve its value:

```jsx
const [text, setText] = useState("kfc");

<input
  type="text"
  value={text}
  onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
/>
```

If you **don’t** want to control the input's value:

```jsx
<input type="text" defaultValue="kfc" />
```

## 🔚 Conclusion

|                | HTML                                        | JSX in React                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `defaultValue` | Works like `value` in HTML — fully editable | Editable once, then uncontrolled         |
| `value`        | Editable                                    | Requires `onChange`, otherwise read-only |
| `class`        | Valid HTML                                  | Use `className` in JSX                   |

React is opinionated about how data flows. It expects you to either **control** a component fully (with `value` + `onChange`) or leave it **uncontrolled** (with `defaultValue`).
