## 📌 HTML vs React: The Key Difference

In plain **HTML**, input fields are part of the DOM. The browser handles their state internally.

```html
<input type="text" value="Hello" />
```

✅ You can click and type, and the value changes — the browser manages this automatically.

---

In **React**, the input field is part of the **virtual DOM**, and React wants to control the UI state. If you use the `value` attribute without telling React how to update it, the input becomes **read-only**.

```jsx
<input type="text" value="Hello" />
```

❌ This **looks the same**, but in React it means:

> “Hey React, this input's value should *always* be 'Hello', and it can never change.”

Since React renders the value from state or props, you must also tell it **how to update** the value — that’s where **manual data binding** comes in.

---

## 🔄 What Is Manual Data Binding in React?

Manual data binding means:

* You **bind** the input’s `value` to a state variable.
* You **handle** the `onChange` event to update that state.

This creates a **controlled component**.

---

### ✅ Example: Manual Data Binding in React

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("Hello");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={inputValue} // Binds state to input
      onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)} // Updates state when input changes
    />
  );
}
```

### 🔍 What’s happening here:

1. React renders `<input>` with the current value from `inputValue`.
2. When you type in the box, `onChange` fires.
3. `setInputValue` updates the state.
4. React re-renders the input with the new state value.

This is **manual two-way data binding**:

> UI → State → UI (via re-render)

## ❗ What Happens If You Skip `onChange`?

```jsx
<input type="text" value="Hello" />
```

This will throw:

```
Warning: You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field.
```

React doesn’t know how to update the value, so it locks the input.

---

## ✅ Uncontrolled Inputs (No Manual Binding)

If you don’t want React to manage the input’s value, you can use `defaultValue`:

```jsx
<input type="text" defaultValue="Hello" />
```

* This is like how it works in plain HTML.
* React sets the initial value, but doesn’t track changes afterward.
* Good for uncontrolled forms, or when you don’t care about the input value immediately.

## ⚖️ Controlled vs Uncontrolled Inputs in React

| Feature            | Controlled Input                           | Uncontrolled Input                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Managed by React?  | ✅ Yes — uses `useState`                    | ❌ No — DOM manages the value             |
| Needs `onChange`?  | ✅ Yes                                      | ❌ No                                     |
| Use `value`?       | ✅ Yes                                      | ❌ Use `defaultValue`                     |
| Real-time updates? | ✅ Yes, reflects in state immediately       | ❌ No, unless you manually read the value |
| Typical Use Cases  | Dynamic forms, validations, controlled UIs | Simple forms, uncontrolled components    |

## 🧠 Why React Works This Way

React uses a **unidirectional data flow**:

* You store data in **state**.
* You render UI **from that state**.
* You update state **via events** (like `onChange`).

This pattern:

* Keeps the UI predictable
* Makes debugging easier
* Allows advanced features like validation, form libraries, etc.

## 📌 Final Example: Simple React Input with Manual Binding

```jsx
function SearchBox() {
  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search here"
        value={searchText}
        onChange={(e) => setSearchText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>You are searching for: {searchText}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Typing in the input updates the state, which then reflects in the UI — a perfect example of **manual data binding in React**.
