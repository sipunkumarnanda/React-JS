### Hooks are functions that enable React developers to use state, lifecycle features, and other capabilities in functional components, making code more concise and easier to maintain. They address problems with logic reuse across components and make functional components more powerful, getting rid of the need for most class components. The most essential hooks are useState for state, useEffect for side effects, and useContext for context. Hooks changed how we organize, share, and reason about code in React

## 📌 Definition

**Hooks** are **functions** that let you “hook into” React’s **features** (like state and lifecycle methods) **inside functional components**.

Before Hooks, these features were only available in **class components**. Now, Hooks allow **functional components** to:

* Store local state
* Run side effects
* Access context
* Manage refs
* And more…

> **Introduced in React 16.8**, Hooks are now the **standard** for writing React logic.

## ✅ Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, if you needed state or lifecycle methods, you had to write:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // fetch data
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>;
  }
}
```

With Hooks, you can write the **same functionality in fewer lines** using a functional component:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch data
  }, []);

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

## 🧩 Commonly Used React Hooks

| Hook          | Purpose                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `useState`    | Adds state to functional components              |
| `useEffect`   | Handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions)  |
| `useContext`  | Accesses React context                           |
| `useRef`      | References DOM elements or stores mutable values |
| `useMemo`     | Memoizes expensive calculations                  |
| `useCallback` | Memoizes functions to avoid re-creating them     |
| `useReducer`  | Alternative to `useState` for complex logic      |

## 🔧 Examples of Core Hooks

### 1. `useState()`

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("John");
```

Creates a state variable `name` with a default value of `"John"`.

---

### 2. `useEffect()`

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted or updated");
}, []);
```

Runs once when the component mounts (because of the empty `[]` dependency array).

---

### 3. `useRef()`

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);

<input ref={inputRef} />
```

Accesses the DOM element directly (like `document.getElementById`).

## ⚠️ Rules of Hooks

To avoid bugs, React enforces these **two rules**:

1. **Only call Hooks at the top level** (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
2. **Only call Hooks inside React functional components or custom Hooks** — not in regular JS functions.

---

## 🧪 Custom Hooks

You can create your own Hooks to reuse logic:

```jsx
function useDocumentTitle(title) {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = title;
  }, [title]);
}
```
